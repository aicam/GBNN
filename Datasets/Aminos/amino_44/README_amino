Set 1.  48 structures of Amino acid dipeptides:  N-acetyl-X-N'-methylamid
                                                 where X is standard aminoacid

2 conformations of each 20 amino acids originally from:

Swanson, J. M. J.; Adcock, S. A.; McCammon, J. A. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005, 1, 484â€“ 493 

+ additional 2 conformations of the neutral conjugate(protonated/deprotonated) of 4 charged ones 
from the original set, that WE ran TI for.

(IT): I have removed "arn-abt" and "lyn-abt" from all lists and crd/ and top/ file set, as Alexey suggested
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The "top" and "crd" files for Set 1 are provided.

All TI calculations were done in TIP3P, using AMBER parm99 force field,
which was converted to CHARMM format to use with PERT module (calculates FEP) in CHARMM.

The TI values provided only includes electostatic part for Set 1.
