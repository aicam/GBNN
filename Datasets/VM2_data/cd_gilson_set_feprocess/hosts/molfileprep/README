However, their chiral centers are incorrectly assigned, so they were not used as is.
Instead, .sd files were generated using Discovery Studio Visualizer and the resulting files

a-cyclodex.mol
b-cyclodex.mol
g-cyclodex.mol

and these .mol files are gathered up into a single .sdf file for processing in the
../prepareHosts directory.
