The 'hand built' alpha-cyclodextrin provided in the Mobley set (see ./mobley_sdf)
was not assigned any paritys. Also, its atom count line is incorrectly formatted.
As such, this file was set aside, and the alpha-cyclodextrin .sdf generated
previously for the cd_gilson_set was used:

ACX-representative.sdf was downloaded from:

www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-srv/pdbechem/

However, the chiral centers are incorrectly assigned, so the file was not used as is.
Instead, an .sd file were generated using Discovery Studio Visualizer and the resulting
non-standard formatted .sd corrected to standard format for sdf/mol. This file was renamed as:

a-cyclodex.sdf



** However, if you wish to use the structure originating from the Mobley data set,
you can find a corrected version of the sdf file at:

    ./fix_mobley_sdf/3_fix_parity/host-acd.sdf

which has also been copied to the current directiory i.e.

    cp ./fix_mobley_sdf/3_fix_parity/host-acd.sdf .
