The following errors present in the set of ligand sdf's from the Mobley dataset
(see ./mobley_ligand_sdfs) must be corrected:

1. No SDFile record separators present, so rename to .mol files.

2. The format of the atom count line is incorrect.

3. Formal charges are not provided and nonsensical bond orders are given for
   carboxylate groups, making 5 coordinate carbon. 

4. Missing parity in guest-s13 and guest-s21.


These errors are fixed in ./fix_mobley_ligand_sdfs and the final corrected set
of .mol files are present in ./fix_mobley_ligand_sdfs/4_fix_parity. These were
copied into this directory and gathered together into an sdf:

    ./cdset2_ligands.sdf
